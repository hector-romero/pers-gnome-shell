  "description": "Yet Another Inhibit Suspend Extension is a GNOME shell extension that adds a switch to the User Menu that gives you the ability to inhibit auto-suspend or screensaver from activating. If you are using other extensions which modify the User Menu as well, make sure you are using the latest version to avoid conflicts (e.g. Alternative Status Menu).\nThis extension is based on few already exisiting extensions with similar functions but different implementation. Translations are welcome (same as Raphael Kimmig's Gnome-Presentation-Mode).",
