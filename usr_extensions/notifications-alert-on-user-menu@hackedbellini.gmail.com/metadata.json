Alert color can be changed on settings ;)\n\nIf you have any question, be sure to take a look at the FAQ:\nhttp://goo.gl/lmwtW\n\nCredits: The idea of painting the message on user's menu was borrowed from 'Pidgin Persistent Notification' extension by nemo. The code itself has some parts forked from 'Message Notifier' extension by barisione, 'Media player indicator' extension by eon and convenience.js from git.gnome.org/gnome-shell-extensions.",
